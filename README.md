# ncfile_extraction
Some python scripts I created during my PhD that extract ncfile time slices of variables.
These were created in relation to the files that are outputted from the Parallel Ice Sheet Model.
Thus, ifyou wish to use these for other perposes they will require editing. 
If you create new scripts from these, please acknowledge the script within the description.
